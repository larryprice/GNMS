1. Description
GNMS was a multi-touch surface project created during Purdue's ECE Senior Design during Spring 2012. This surface used frustrated total internal reflection (FTIR) technology. This software was not stand-alone: reacTIVision is required to interface with a camera, and the TUIO and SDL C++ libraries are required for the code to work. This software was designed to be living code; instead of being installed to specific directories on the processor, it should be compiled as necessary.

2. Bugs and Suggestions
At this point, bugs found in the project will likely not be addressed by the authors. Email larry.price.dev@gmail.com if you think we might be interested. Feel free to have a go at it yourself.
